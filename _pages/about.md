I have always been drawn to investigative reporting, where persistence and curiosity guide us reporters to places others might never consider. My desire to master investigative reporting and data visualization techniques led me to UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism where I am now a first-year student. 

With just one semester under my belt, I have already produced data-driven stories using R, Python, QGIS and Illustrator. I produced small multiple maps revealing the correlation of depression with other diseases such as asthma, stroke and heart attack across US counties. The findings showed a strong connection between depression and asthma as well as heart disease, drawing praise from experts who deemed it "unusual and impressive." 

Additionally, I produced a cluster map tracking car theft hotspots in Oakland. The story appeared on Oakland North and became the most viewed in the site’s 10-year history. 

I have acquired the skills necessary for both reporting and data analysis, I am comfortable working and learning in a fast-changing news environment. Feel free to contact me!
