 I am a first year Master's journalism student at the University of California, Berkeley. I focus on data reporting and data visualization. I have already produced data-driven projects, such as a map tracking sheltered women's percentage change from 2021 to 2022. 
 
 Additionally, I'm working on a side project that analyzes the correlations between mental disabilities and factors such as race, age, and income across various counties. 
 
 Previously, I was a reporter at a weekly financial magazine in Taiwan with a focus on politics, culture and education. I discovered an investment misconduct by reviewing the Labor Pension Fund’s documents. I won the Taiwan New Economy Foundation’s Financial Awards with this story. Later, I transitioned to a monthly geographic magazine, focusing on climate change. I used open data to expose flaws in Taiwan’s new energy framework. 

With over two years of reporting experience and a strong background in Economics, I possess the skills needed for both reporting and data analysis. I developed a judgment for news, and I am proficient in R, Python, SPSS, and Excel.
