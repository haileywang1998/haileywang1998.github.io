This map displays the relationship between the prevalence of depression and asthma. The color of the triangles represents the depression rate, while the height of the triangles indicates the asthma rate. Based on your observation, counties with a higher prevalence of depression also tend to have a higher asthma rate. This may suggest the existence of a correlation or association.
